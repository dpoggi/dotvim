# Dotvim
My .vim folder. It has a lot of submodules. Credits, of course, go to their respective authors.

## Installation
Either clone the repository as your .vim folder and run `git submodule update --init`, or install my dotfiles (https://github.com/dpoggi/dcp).

## Powerline
If you want to use Powerline (and have the appropriate fonts installed to do so), add this to `~/.vim/vimrc.local`:

```
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/powerline/powerline/bindings/vim
```
